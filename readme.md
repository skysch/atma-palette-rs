# Atma
## A structured color palette format & editor.

(Atma is currently in design, and is very much a work-in-progress.)

This library contains a CLI application for editing structured color palettes -- color palettes modelled with explicit relationships between colors.

Atma can be used to plan a color palette by naming and organizing colors into groups based on their purpose. Given a palette designed this way, it should be possible to 'seed' the palette with a few input colors and have the remainder be automatically generated.
